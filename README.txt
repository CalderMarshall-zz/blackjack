This is a simple blackjack game in javascript using jQuery. 
Need to add:
	restarting the game once it is over
	hiding buttons based on conditions

	encapsulate similar functions and statements
	place the functions and statements outside of the document ready
	call these functions and statements with jQuery in the doc ready
